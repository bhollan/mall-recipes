Welcome to Mall-Recipes.  The home of everything mall cops love to eat, and anything else anybody decides to put in.

I'm hoping to get this deployed to heroku eventually.  Maybe next time it won't take 24 hours.

I'm also hoping to have a SQLite branch and a PostgreSQL branch.  The differences should be minimal compared to the size of the app.  It should just be a few lines in some config files, but the install/setup of a PostgreSQL server locally has been a royal pain.
